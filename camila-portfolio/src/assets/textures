The directory for textures is intended to hold texture files for 3D models and interactive elements. Since you requested the contents of the textures directory, I will provide a comment indicating that this directory is intentionally left blank for now, as it typically contains image files (like .jpg, .png, etc.) that would be added later.

Here are the contents for the file:

/camila-portfolio/camila-portfolio/src/assets/textures
